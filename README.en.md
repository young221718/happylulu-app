## Downloads

| Platform | Direct download | Requirements · details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Mac 1.5.5 · build13** | [Download DMG](https://github.com/young221718/happylulu-app/releases/download/macos-v1.5.5-build13/HappyLulu-1.5.5-universal.dmg) · [ZIP](https://github.com/young221718/happylulu-app/releases/download/macos-v1.5.5-build13/HappyLulu-1.5.5-universal.zip) | macOS 13+ · Universal · [Release and checksums](https://github.com/young221718/happylulu-app/releases/tag/macos-v1.5.5-build13) |
| **Windows 1.2.1** | [Download ZIP](https://github.com/young221718/happylulu-app/releases/download/windows-v1.2.1/HappyLulu-1.2.1-windows-x64-runtime-required.zip) | Windows 10/11 x64 · .NET 10 Desktop Runtime x64 required · [Installation guide](windows/README.en.md) |

**Mac 1.5.10 · build25 is a development candidate, not a public release.** Calendar and unified settings descriptions refer to that Mac candidate. Public automatic update-feed deployment and actual installed-app validation remain incomplete. Windows has no calendar sync or built-in automatic updater.

<a id="three-small-steps"></a>

## Quick start

1. **Give it a home.** On Mac, open the DMG and move the app to `Applications` or `~/Applications`. On Windows, install .NET 10 Desktop Runtime x64, then extract the entire ZIP to a permanent folder. Quit the old app before replacing it in the same location.
2. **Click the smiling clock.** Open the menu bar or tray panel. Enter your arrival and workday mode if you have already arrived.
3. **Make it yours.** Choose work and break hours, language and countdown format in settings.

## Keep what matters within reach

- **Time at a glance.** See arrival, expected departure and remaining time in the menu bar or tray. Choose five display formats and Korean or English.
- **Your workday, your settings.** Set work and break hours, morning or afternoon half days, and the last-Friday reduction.
- **Less record keeping.** While running, the app records the first valid screen unlock and preserves manual edits and day-off choices.
- **Calendar details together.** The Mac candidate brings half-day recognition and optional calendar setup, previews and sync into unified settings. [Supported scope (Korean)](CALENDAR.md)
- **Personal records stay local.** Attendance works without an account. Mac and Windows attendance records do not sync with each other.

HappyLulu is a personal convenience tool, not the company's official attendance, payroll or meal-payment system.
