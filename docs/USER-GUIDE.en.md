Detailed installation, workday calculations, settings, calendars, records and updates. This guide describes **current source and the Mac 1.5.10 build25 candidate**, which has not been publicly released. Public downloads are Mac 1.5.5 build13 and Windows 1.2.1.

## A small app for a lighter day

- **Today, within reach.** Check your arrival and departure countdown. Enter an arrival manually if you have already started.
- **Your routine.** Set work and break hours, half days, five countdown formats, and Korean or English.
- **Two hours earlier on the last Friday.** Regular workdays get the monthly reduction automatically.
- **Your records, on your computer.** Attendance works without an account. Connect calendars on Mac when you need them.

HappyLulu is a personal convenience tool, not the company's official attendance or payroll system.

The guide below describes the **current source and development candidate**. Check the [Mac](../RELEASE-NOTES.md) and [Windows](../windows/RELEASE-NOTES.md) notes for features in each public version. Mac and Windows attendance records do not sync with each other.

## Three small steps

1. **Download and give it a home.** On Mac, move the app from the DMG or ZIP to Applications or ~/Applications. On Windows, install the Desktop Runtime and extract the entire ZIP to a permanent folder. Quit the old app before replacing it in the same location.
2. **Click the smiling clock.** Open the menu bar or tray panel. Enter your arrival and workday mode if you have already arrived.
3. **Make it yours.** Choose work and break hours, language and countdown format. Calendar setup is optional.

Mac first launch attempts login-item registration and may require system approval. A disabled preference stays disabled. Windows startup is enabled explicitly in settings. Follow the installation steps above and the [Windows README](../windows/README.en.md).

## Today in the menu bar. Settings in one place.

The 1.5.10 candidate puts settings in one window with a sidebar, including Calendar.

| View | Controls |
| --- | --- |
| Today | Countdown, arrival, expected departure, workday mode and day off |
| General | Language, countdown format and login startup |
| Work | Work and break hours |
| Attendance | Last seven records and record folder |
| Calendar | Half-day recognition, account setup, preview, sync, conflicts and holds |
| Updates | Version and automatic check/install preferences |

Choose milliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours or hours/minutes. Hours round up to one decimal: **90 minutes → 1.5 hours**, **30 minutes → 0.5 hours**. The menu bar and panel use the same preference, which survives a restart.

## How a day is calculated

The default is eight work hours plus one break hour. Arrival windows include their final minute.

| Mode | Arrival window | Default example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Regular | 08:00–10:00 | 09:00 → 18:00 |
| Afternoon off | 08:00–10:00 | 09:00 → 13:00 |
| Morning off | 13:00–15:00 | 13:00 → 17:00 |

Regular days finish two hours earlier on the last calendar Friday of the month. Half days use four hours without a break or an extra Friday reduction. Holidays do not move this rule to another date.

The Mac candidate records the first valid **observed** login-item launch or screen unlock. Later unlocks preserve arrival, manual edits and day-off choices. Ordinary manual launch, wake and session activation do not create arrivals. The app does not reconstruct hours when it was closed or detect office location/Wi-Fi; an unlock at home may count.

Day off clears today's arrival after confirmation and suspends automatic recording. Saving a manual arrival resumes it. Extra elapsed minutes appear 30 minutes after scheduled departure; a meal time threshold appears after two hours. These do not verify work or approve payment.

## Calendars, when you need them

On Mac, open **Settings → Calendar**. macOS Internet Accounts manages account login and credentials. Two-way sync requires **full calendar access**.

1. Connect your own Google and DaouOffice accounts in macOS.
2. Select test calendars from different accounts.
3. Review planned changes, holds and conflicts before starting.

The 1.5.10 candidate preserves ordinary display reminders. Recurring events are copied as individual occurrences within **30 days before through 365 days after today**. Invitations become personal copies without re-inviting attendees, and the original stays protected. Automatic deletion, out-of-range occurrences and special alarms remain held with a reason.

Resume a paused connection after a fresh preview. A successful local macOS calendar save is separate from confirmation on both web servers. [Calendar setup, supported fields and recovery (Korean)](../CALENDAR.md).

Optional half-day recognition reads accessible calendar titles. Shared events may be mistaken for yours; choose a manual mode or disable recognition. Manual selection takes priority.

## Records and updates

Mac attendance stays in `~/Library/Application Support/AfterSix/state.json`. The app identifier and existing storage path are retained. Never delete records to update the app. Calendar connection state is local; macOS manages credentials. No attendance telemetry, keyboard or screen collection is added.

Automatic checking, downloading, idle installation and fixed self-signing are implemented in the candidate. **Public update-feed deployment and actual installed-app validation remain incomplete.** Older versions with updates disabled need one manual replacement with an enabled version. Track [update preparation](../UPDATES.md) and [issue #3](https://github.com/young221718/happylulu-app/issues/3).

Apple Developer ID/notarization and Windows publisher signing are incomplete. Universal builds include Intel code, but Intel physical testing is pending. Follow managed-device policy. Older versions may preserve but stop writing records containing an unsupported login source; do not remove the records to downgrade.

## Development and evidence

Use Swift 6 and macOS Command Line Tools. Windows has its own [.NET build guide](../windows/README.en.md).

```sh
swift run --build-system native AfterSixChecks
swift run --build-system native CalendarSyncChecks
swift run --build-system native CalendarSyncServiceChecks
bash scripts/build-app.sh
```

Mac PR CI checks core logic, isolated integration, ad-hoc app packaging and Sparkle configuration without private signing keys. See [UPDATES.md](../UPDATES.md) for local fixed signing, signed installation tests and Universal release checks.

Automated checks, app builds, actual device behavior and web-server readback are separate evidence. Track [validation](../VALIDATION.md), [Mac device checks #4](https://github.com/young221718/happylulu-app/issues/4) and [login startup #13](https://github.com/young221718/happylulu-app/issues/13).

Changes follow **issue → task branch → checks and independent review → PR → merge → signing/deployment → readback**. Keep personal records, keys, credentials and generated apps out of Git.

## Releases and website

GitHub owns source, CI, release assets, checksums and the signed update feed. The [website](https://happylulu.cy-choi-lulu.chatgpt.site/) focuses on the product, an interactive demo and download links. See [DEPLOYMENT.md](../DEPLOYMENT.md) for preparation, verification, draft releases, promotion and readback. Website source lives in [site/](../site/README.md). Private signing keys stay in the maintainer’s local keychain; CI does not publish an unverified signed update. The GitHub feed migration requires a one-time installation for existing apps using the old Site feed.
